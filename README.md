Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. It leverages a real-world dataset with anonymized features and aims to develop an accurate and robust classifier to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent transactions.

__Project Objectives__

- Load and explore the credit card transactions dataset.
- Handle missing values and checking for class imbalance using resampling techniques.
- Train machine learning model Random Forest Classifier.
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Visualize key insights and metrics.

  __Tools & Libraries__
- Python
- NumPy, Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

*__Note__ *
The dataset is highly imbalanced, so evaluation metrics like precision and recall are emphasized over accuracy.
